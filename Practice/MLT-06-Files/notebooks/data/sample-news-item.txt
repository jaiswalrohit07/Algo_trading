TAIPEI, April 15 (Reuter) - Taiwan's money rates finished
mixed on Monday, dealers expecting overnight to rise further
amid current bullish stock market and income tax payments.
    Overnight ended at 6.134 percent against Saturday's 5.949,
while 30-day commercial paper fell to 7.00 from 7.10-7.15.
    Though Taiwan share prices hit a new 11-month high on
Monday, attracting liquidity into the stock market, bond traders
did not expect significantly tighter conditions as the central
bank monetary policy remains relaxed.
